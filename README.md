# identification-cards
The Toxic Organisms Research Centre (TORC) is dedicated to advancing research on venomous organisms, particularly snakes, scorpions, and other toxic species in Sudan, the MENA region, and East Africa. Our mission is to contribute to the scientific understanding of these species, focusing on their venom composition, molecular biology, epidemiology, and their impact on public health.
These identification cards, developed by TORC, are designed to help identify scorpion and snake species in the region and to raise awareness about these venomous organisms.
